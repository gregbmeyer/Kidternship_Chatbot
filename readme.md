Kidternship readme file
Uses NLTK and Sci-kit Learn packages
The code pulls in either text from Dr Seuss books or an imaginary Taco Stand FAQ.
The student can run the code as it is and interact with it to understand a very basic chatbot implementation.
The code uses cosine similarity to find the next response for 'chat'
Additional complexity can be achieved by the student by turning the texts into vector databases and using langchain cosine similarity (part of the LLM interaction of huge fame right now)
